An extremely weak Rubik's Cube solver.

I'm primarily interesting in finding better algorithms for completing the cube after [F2L](http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/First_Two_Layers).  I use a modified [Petrus method](http://lar5.com/cube/), so the edges are already aligned.  This program was written with the idea of finding 2-gen algorithms for completing the cube from this state.
